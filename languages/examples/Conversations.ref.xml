Unfortunately, it's encrypted, and we do not have the means here to decrypt it. You may be of some help in this matter, however.

        We've long known the location of a fully functioning &amp;Wbaetyl&amp;y within the bowels of the great hall &amp;CBethesda Susa&amp;y. The Mechanimists have consecrated the site around it and built a temple there. Q Girl claims to have developed a means to decrypt the signal, but she needs the computing power of the baetyl. If you can infiltrate the Mechanimist compound, you may be able to engage the baetyl and decode the signal.

        They are antique stones located in certain places deep within the caverns of Qud. We believe they are some sort of hyper-advanced machines built by the Eaters. Often one claims to possess a sentience of its own. However, most of them have gone haywire in the eons since their creation; it is rare indeed to discover one whose circuitry is wholly uncorroded.

        The Mechanimists worship this one as an idol, and they will protect it at all costs. You will need to find a way through their host to the baetyl itself.

        Do you believe you can accomplish this task?

        Good, =factionaddress:Barathrumites=. Speak to &amp;mQ Girl&amp;y in the workshop. She'll encode her instructions for the baetyl onto a copy of the disk.

        There's one more thing. The baetyl is located beneath the ancient cryobarrios of the Eaters. Time has worked to erode the mechanisms that contain their cryogenic mist. That freezing vapor billows out of the chambers freely now, cooling the entire cavern. You will want to procure warm clothing to protect =player.reflexive=.

        The spoils of the Mechanimists are yours to keep. Remember, =factionaddress:Barathrumites=, Barathrum will look kindly upon your service.

Unfortunately, a troublesome merchant from the Consortium of Phyta has relocated there and declared xerself Earl of Omonporch.

				Yes, the question of power is a trickier one. Our standard power sources might suffice, but they would be vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks on the ascent, and we believe it within the competency of the Putus Templar to execute such an attack.
				
				This leaves us two options. Klanq and Q Girl have worked out a design for a neutronic battery, free from vulnerabilities on the EM spectrum. But it requires 3 drams of neutron flux. The alternative is remote power, but to carry us across the Spindle's length the source would have to be extraordinary. I would look to Chavvah, the Tree of Life, for a psychic quickening.

				The beacon confirmed my hypothesis. The Spindle is an elevator, engineered by the Eaters to convey freight to and from the vault of heaven. You see, nestling, in the earliest aurora of our past, the Eaters of Earth were joined by a great coven of beings that spanned the firmament. But the Eaters succumbed to some terrible temptation, and an injunction was placed on our world.

				Since then, the stars were silent to us, and our world was left to molder and decay. But something changed. The signal affirms that an entity roosts atop the Spindle, and invites us to join it.

        I have visited the rainbow wood but once, and there I sampled an array of strange foods, one of which allowed me an unusual lens through which to view the world. It was nothing like I had ever experienced, and I imagined such wondrous recipes. I wrote them all down as best I could, of course.

        Sadly, once I returned to my ordinary frame of reference, my scribblings proved impossible to read. So it goes.

        What you smell is Grit Gate's signature dish. The Porridge is a recipe passed down through generations of Barathrumites, and it is the food that inspired me to pursue my craft. Yes, outsiders quail at the intensity of the scent, for its flavor is as bold as its effects!

        We use cuisine to channel lightning from our bodies! Other recipes may let us breathe fire, or learn the secrets of the Eaters. The Porridge is as precious a part of our legacy as the Barathrum Clock or the foaminator.

        Oh, it changes by the hour, sometimes the minute. Preserve this, observe that, add anything, taste everything.

        But the starapple of my eye, the Spindle up which I cast my ambitious gaze... is edible vapor. Food that you eat, food that you breathe. Sadly, to date the most I have managed is an herbed saline suspension. Salty air, if you will.

        Look about you. Every instrument you see is precision-calibrated, every tool handcrafted and built to last. In this room, sustenance and ingenuity come together to evolve cuisine itself, to shape not this culture alone but, over time, every culture. Is that kind of influence the product of a kitchen? Can a simple clay oven in the flower fields do what we do here? Has every kitchen an indelible influence over Qud?

        Every ingredient in the soup of collective knowledge is a valuable one, and who am I to elevate myself over more humble pioneers? But! All the more reason for us to regard cuisine (and by extension, culture itself) to be a scientific endeavor, an ongoing trial-and-error, a blending of what we know and what we don't know, calling upon reality itself to be our guide.

It's a wonder, isn't it, how at just the right temperature and pressure the continuity of matter is smashed apart? How the gaseous butterfly flits out of the dense worm?

        After supper I like to retreat to the library, take a storybook off the shelves, flop down on the chairbear, and lose myself in another world. Many of these worlds feature palaces, markets, gardens, ships. Many of those places have bells. When they do, I always think of Mafeo. More than anyone else, Mafeo could be a character in the bright world of a story, where this dusty place is itself confined to a mere storybook.

        As I came along, scampered through the halls, listened to the stories Neek read me, climbed onto Sparafucile's workbench to have my screws replaced, I realized I was not what I could be. And so I downgraded myself to Shem 1.

        Beauty manifest, whose chromium shoals are Awe itself. In my belief system, She's the being from whom all metal was birthed, out in the ever-void. There are pieces of Her in every chrome belfry and every machine. Even bits of Her in our own blood.

        For me, Her essence extends beyond mere metal. Anything that's ordered, She infuses: a poem, a mathematical proof, a clean workspace... so definitely not Q Girl's.

        Don't I know it. I've had to invent eight separate systems of organization to manage them all. At the moment I'm trying out a new one, Harmonices Spiralis. Spiral towers with heights increasing according to the harmonic series of numbers. It's... fine.

        The problem is I'm always inscribing more disks. New contraptions. Reverse-engineered artifacts. It's a good problem to have, I suppose.

        Take a look. See if any interest you.

        It's a big bear city with a lot of books and scratched brass and strange noises. But if you start chanting in sync with the noises Otho will hush you. It's sort of like this, let me explain.

        Iseppa is napping so you peek into her room and rearrange her papers. Then you walk down the hall and say "ding ding" so Mafeo shakes his head and dings back. Then you foaminate by Hortensa. You foaminate right on by. You hug her too. Then you scoot over and hug Spara. Then you scoot over to Jacobo and look over his shoulder and nod like this.

        You go and run at Q Girl and tap all the gadgets and tap her on the head. Then you sneak by Otho's office. Then you hug Shem -1 and you drag them to the library and read to them. Sometimes Barathrum and Hortensa are in there, and they smile at you. Then you get hungry and you roll toward the kitchen. You slurp honey from the vase and Dardi glares at you. You say, "I'm just 'jidding'." Then you climb the pipes and whisper to Aloysius, "Live and drink, live and drink, live and drink." Then you pat the chromelings on their heads. You say to Ereshkigal, "boom boom boom boom boom I love you." Then you sneak into storage and pat all the chromelings on their heads. You take a nap in the peptic chair. Then you get a bright idea and go back to your room to write it in your notebook.

        Golgotha is an execrable place in more ways than one, and I would advise you not to visit without a healthy stock of yuckwheat and honey. If you can cook, a meal with yuckwheat may banish a disease before it comes into its own. Bring salves or urberries, too, and mind your feet in the Cloaca.

        There is a river just south of the village that runs an eastwardly course into the jungle. Along its bank lies a goatfolk village. There resides a mighty shaman, Mamon Souldrinker. He is in possession of a talisman of great power, an amaranthine prism that refracts the psyche of its handler in much the same way, as Mayor Nuntu has explained to me, a common prism refracts light. The thing is cursed, traveler. No man or goat may safely wield it for long. You must travel to the village and retrieve the prism from Mamon by any means necessary. Do you understand?

    <node ID="Raising3b">
      <text>
        There is. Firstly, Mamon will likely have several goatfolk under his enthrallment, and they will protect him at all costs.

        Secondly, take care to stay out of Mamon's reach, for his power is most potent when he may lay hands on you.

        Finally, once you recover the prism, do not under any circumstances wield it. I needn't warn you of the consequences should you return to me bearing that charm.

        That is all. Are you willing?

        Good.

        We hindren are a close-knit and staid people, and our safety depends on our solidarity. In order to preserve our safety and culture, we ask that any of our number who leave us never come back. Recently, one such exile took the treasure of our village, a bracelet named Kindrish, with her when she left. None of our number can leave to get it back, or it will be a violation of the values that I have guarded, and the Hindriarchs before me, for countless generations.

        Will you help us recover our treasure? We have a small cache of valuables we can offer as a reward.

        Excellent. I will do my best to reward you to your satisfaction.

        Though her name is sand in my mouth now, the exile who stole Kindrish is called Eskhind. She left a few weeks ago, and took her sister and brother with her. I don't know where she's gone, but Warden Neelahind might, as they were close friends as children.

        Find the exile called Eskhind and retrieve Kindrish from her, even... even if the cost is the life of her and her siblings. Kindrish has been handed down over countless generations, and it belongs to my people, not any individual. Go, kendren. Speak to Warden Neelahind, and find out where Eskhind is hidden.

        She's lying. Our people have a long history of two-gender hindren called {{w|hartind}}, respected and consecrated. There is a proper path to gender variance in our society, of which the male exile could have availed himself years ago.

      <text ID="Clue_BulgingWaterskin" Thief="Esk">No, no. Eskhind makes the most of what few possessions she keeps, and if she traded a treasure for so much water, she'd never have lost track of any.</text>

        The evidence is clear: Eskhind did not steal Kindrish. In fact, I believe that no hindren was responsible for its theft, but one of the kendren who permeated our borders well before our investigator arrived. Any of them could have committed the theft.

        Eskhind is free to go, and I'm... I'm going with her. I cannot serve under Hindriarch Keh while my beloved returns to exile.

        I have no doubt that Bey Lah will thrive in my absence as it did before I became warden. Live and drink, my kin. Long may Hindriarch Keh lead you.

        Keh is very wise and very careful, which makes up for her lack of strength or... tact. She always knows what's right, and she runs a very tight shift.

        She hates clutter from work like nothing else and cleans up any mess she makes--unless it's a spill, then she makes Kesehind do it. It's because Grand-Doe has a terrible fear of standing pools of water, refusing to touch them. Copper and bronze afflict her with allergy-sores and she can't touch them. She's too old to spar with me, but her bow-arm still aims true.

        That's all I can think of.

        Bey Lah's isolationism provides ideal patsies for any crime the Hindriarch chooses to commit.

        The Hindriarch is the most likely suspect, in my opinion. She might have kept it for herself or sold it. I've been suspicious of her pet bodyguard, Kesehind, for years--I wouldn't put it past him to steal the treasure himself.

        That said, it might have been an outsider like you. I doubt any of the villagers had the nerve to steal such a valuable object, but I suppose it's faintly possible.

        But it wasn't Neelahind. You won't find a purer heart in all of Qud than hers.

        Extremely frustrating! But I am yet hopeful.

        My people are resistant to change, but they don't seem opposed to the idea of a Democracy. I need to give them a measure of time before we hold an election, but they'll ultimately agree as long as I am acting Hindriarch.

        Ere any prosecution can commence, Accusers must obtain some evidence. The solving lies in seeing and locating Supporting clues as well as implicating.

        Professor Cones taught me everything about finding evidence!

        Though evidence you found upon the ground may yet be sound, If it will be sufficient is a toss-up. Examine all your suspects and their homes and all around, And find a witness who may dish the gossip.

        You can find evidence by looking at things on the ground, but you can also look at your suspects to see if there's anything off about them. You can also ask around to see if anyone has seen or heard anything strange, and different witnesses may have different things to report.

    <node ID="Defining evidence">
      <text>
        Evidence is any sign of something gone amiss. The Great Plant Detective gave some good examples in Act II of the tragedy of Gimlet:

        So! Sweep the full estate for signs of {{W|trade}}, their shady night-time dealings to expose Now look for signs of {{W|craft}}, see what was made For to conceal a treasure hidden close. But darker still, if {{W|illness}} signs we find A desperate contagion may yet lurk And darkest yet, more {{W|violence}} may reply To those who stumble 'pon their grisly work.

    <node ID="Implicating evidence">
      <text>
        Implicating evidence is what it sounds like: evidence that implicates someone's involvement in a crime. For example, if someone observed strange behavior in a person, or if you found something weird in a person's room, or even if you observe them behaving strangely =player.reflexive=! That's implicating evidence.

        Most of the time, a piece of implicating evidence isn't proof of a crime in and of itself, but when presented alongside supporting evidence, implicating evidence is the seed of truth from which grows the long frond of justice.

    <node ID="Supporting evidence">
      <text>
        Supporting evidence can be any sign that something is amiss that you can't directly tie to an individual. One common example is a bloodstain, which indicates that violence was committed but doesn't tell you by whom.

        At its heart, supporting evidence is most powerful when paired with implicating evidence. Once you have both, you'll be in a good position to accuse a suspect of wrongdoing.

        Neelahind knows everyone in the village very well. If you present supporting evidence that contradicts something the Warden knows to be true about the suspect, well, she probably won't believe you. In fact, she might not let you accuse that person again, so be careful.

        Tinker-nuns. The world sees fit to call us that, my sisters and me.

        Do you know the story told of Rebekah the Exile? She was a teacher to Resheph, but he excommunicated her from the sultanate and banished her from the realm.

        To know her, I've chosen a life of unbelonging. And among my sisters, I have the honor of permanent residence by her gravesite.

        I'll tell you this, traveler: the shape of a society is visible only from the outside, and there is peace beyond a boundary.

        Ezra sits in the shadow of history, where small things grow. It's the moss beneath the statue, quite literally. For centuries monarchs concerned themselves with felling trees, and now of the Covenate only Ezra remains.

        It's home to Rebekah's gravesite, so for the Daughters, it is a sacred place. You may notice more of us on pilgrimage.

        I was once a vile graverobber, the lowest of the low. Years ago I sought to plunder the Tomb of the Eaters, and set off to do so with a pair of confederates. I watched both of them die, slain by ancient artifice and entombed with the ancient dead.

        I would have shared their fate, but for a coterie of mopango nesting in the catacombs. They kept me safe and fed me while I treated my wounds. It is in their honor that I seek a credo now.

        Yes. It is a rite of passage for the mopango people: a statement that inspires contemplation, discussion, and thought. An ideal credo has no single explanation or interpretation and is meant to inspire contemplation in those who hear it. For this reason, it is considered rude among mopango to ask the meaning of a credo.

        Someday I will find mine.

        Mopango are plated, digging creatures whose armor scales glow a pale white. They are contemplative, sociable, and mostly peaceful. They commune with ancient objects, which is why a coterie of their kind lives in the Tomb of the Eaters.

        They are patient even with rough-hewn wanderers such as we, but it's still not best to ask one to explain eir credo.

        Rebekah was a physician, and an advisor to Resheph until she lost his favor. When, after years of exile, she lost her voice and her life, she was buried here, an outsider unfit to be interred with the honored dead. So she rests here.

        I believe her proximity will help me find my credo.

        Ezra is more than tree-old. It's stone-old. Seedlings have lived here since our roots dreamed of joggling their fingers at the salt sky.

        They ate earth and belched freight at the stars, and this place was their stomach.

        Later, as the Star-Tree died and they buried their dead under its roots, this was their funerary place.

        Now, we nurse electric milk from the old and aching temple to turn our wheels and grind our seeds and grains. Now we are they.

        Ezra is old and has long since cut a groove into the world and resides there in stillness and harmony. But Zothom the Penitent One is a seedling, new to the world, and he quakes at all the tensing the world does. Perhaps you can share in his angst.

        Yes, we were present, if less active than other-bodies. But we saw, and rattle with memory-artifacts as a Consortium lockbox rattles with jewels; shards of an eon-old data disk, bits of stories and places. Kin-fleeing, louse-meals, ghastly boredom. But Fate's caprice brought us through history's footsteps. There was a machine-speaker, and her ursine apprentice with his little plant, and the Sower with a tetrad of chubby whelps, and then, at last, Many-Eyes. Our dear galgal. So many.

				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~

				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				I can lick the flanges free of their pipe milk and hear my tongue fizzle in foam!~
				Girsh Agolgot! Red dusts in my nails and burning hot bubbles swell in my glands! Now I point to the future.~
				The world stews and titrates.
				O, the thrill of coursing Change within. Each pump of the heart drives it deeper. Each breath a breath of new life.~
