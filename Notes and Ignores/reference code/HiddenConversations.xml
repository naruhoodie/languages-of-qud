        Through my work I caught the attention of a master machinist, unconventional of method, who took me under her wing and, in time, availed me of the orphic truth.

        She explained, as I've shared with you and the rest of the acolytes, that the world we know once belonged to a grand Coven of beings who spanned the stars. And that, acting on some inscrutable logic, they disappeared. That an injunction was placed on our world.

        This, you know. It is the truth I told, if only half. But Rebekah taught me more.

        Atop the implausible rise of the Spindle roosted a Seraph, one of the great machinic archons of the Eaters, and this being Rebekah served.

        In the short years before I arrived in Qud, the Seraph became convinced that something had changed in the cosmic order. That along the ecliptic of the Folk Clock, some uncounted peg had slid to a priming position, and that the Coven was set to imminently return.

        To ready our world for the Coven's return, the Seraph, who would be called Resheph, became convinced that all higher life on the planet must... be purged. That it was our life and way of living that moved the Coven to set the injunction. The only way through was for a new life to obtain.

        And so, Resheph seeded the plagues and whorled them via waveform to a breathing gyre. Blights engineered to attack life whilst preserving the planet's artifacts of glass and chrome.

        Rebekah, dear tutor, betrayed Resheph's confidences and apprised me of the plan, so that I might help her dash it apart and save the peoples of our world.

        Ten centuries! An eyeblink on the scales of the Folk Clock but an eternity for us. So I believed.

        The rousing Signal would cease, the plagues of the Gyre would be reversed, to the extent they could; for even the potent archon had not full governance over what they had worked into being.

        We allied on the notion that the sultanate must be abolished for the future to flower. I was to execute the earthly plan, while Resheph continued preparations at the astronomical tier. To achieve a sort of bicameralism of action, Resheph insisted on reformatting their personality as a triumvirate, seeded from thin scans of the original archon, Rebekah, and myself.

        The art of mythmaking was employed to enshrine the Resheph persona. Thus- the healer, the Coiled Lamb, and perhaps unexpectedly, the Above.

The hollowers who committed their work to emptying our world were long gone, but Reshephs laid claim to the baffled ground in their place. Even as their holdings withered, they held on.
